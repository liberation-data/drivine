Drivine is a graph database client for Node.js and TypeScript. It was created with the following design goals: 

* Support multiple graph databases (simultaneously, if you wish). Currently [AgensGraph](https://bitnine.net/agensgraph/) and 
[Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/neo4j-graph-database/) (or other BOLT compatible graph DBs). 
* **Scale to hundreds and thousands of transactions per second, without compromising architectural integrity.**

---------------------------------------

With regards to the second point on scaleability, let's break that down into component facets. 

## Features

* Facilitates the use of <a href="https://drivine.org/guide/#/repositories">well understood object-oriented</a> and functional programming patterns. 
* Supports implementation of code that adheres to a single responsibility principle (SRP). [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) will be optional, but is recommended. 
* Takes care of <a href="https://drivine.org/guide/#/persistence-manager">infrastructure concerns</a>, so that you can focus on making the most of your data. 
* <a href="https://drivine.org/guide/#/transactions">Removes boiler plate code</a>, especially the tedious and error-prone kind. 
* <a href="https://drivine.org/guide/#/cursors">Supports streaming</a>, without back-pressure. Large amounts of data can be managed in a timely and memory efficient manner. 
* Light-weight _use-case specific_ <a href="https://drivine.org/guide/#/object-mapping">object graph mapping (OGM)</a>. Drivine is NOT an OGM in the traditinoal sense. The results are then mapped to/from a use-case specific model object.

## Quick Start

Follow the **<a href="https://github.com/liberation-data/drivine/wiki">Quick Start</a>** section in our **<a href="https://github.com/liberation-data/drivine/wiki">User Guide</a>** or clone the **<a href="https://github.com/liberation-data/drivine-inspiration">sample app</a>** and use it as a starter template. 


Start creating repositories like the one below. 
```typescript
@Injectable()
export class RouteRepository {
    constructor(
        @InjectPersistenceManager() readonly persistenceManager: PersistenceManager,
        @InjectCypher('@/traffic/routesBetween') readonly routesBetween: CypherStatement) {
    }

    @Transactional() // Has default Propagation.REQUIRED - partipicate in a current txn, or start one.
    public async findFastestBetween(start: string, destination: string): Promise<Route> {
        return this.persistenceManager.getOne(
            new QuerySpecification<Route>()
                .withStatement(this.routesBetween)
                .bind([start, destination])
                .limit(1)
                .transform(Route)
        );
    }
}
```

## Example Applications

If you use `Drivine` and your code is public, feel free to make [PR](https://github.com/liberation-data/drivine/pulls) and add yourself to the list.

### Quick Start Template

Clone the official **[sample app](https://github.com/liberation-data/drivine-inspiration)** and start hacking. 

Repository: [github.com/liberation-data/drivine-inspiration](https://github.com/liberation-data/drivine-inspiration) 

This sample is a basic starter template, with some tutorials. It has some endpoints for traffic routing, movies/films and other typical use-cases. Rather than start from scratch, choose the one that closely matches yours, and modify. 

### SlackMap

New version of [slackmap.com](https://slackmap.com) is full rewrite with technology update.
The `OrientDB` was replaced with `Neo4j` and we choose `Drivine` as the way to work with the database.

Check out how `Drivine` supports `Neo4j` in `Full Stack JavaScript App` using `Angular` + `Nest` + `Nx Workspace Monorepo`.

Repository: [github.com/SlackMap/slackmap](https://github.com/SlackMap/slackmap) 

* **master** branch - not released yet
* **develop** branch - has all the current work
