Drivine is a graph database client for Node.js and TypeScript. It was created with the following design goals: 

* Support multiple graph databases (simultaneously, if you wish). Currently [AgensGraph](https://bitnine.net/agensgraph/) and 
[Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/neo4j-graph-database/). 
* **Scale to hundreds and thousands of transactions per second, without compromising architectural integrity.**

---------------------------------------

With regards to the second point on scaleability, let's break that down into component facets. 

## Features

* Facilitates the use of <a href="https://github.com/liberation-data/drivine/wiki/Repositories">well understood object-oriented</a> and functional programming patterns. 
* Supports implementation of code that adheres to a single responsibility principle (SRP). [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) will be optional, but is recommended. 
* Takes care of <a href="https://github.com/liberation-data/drivine/wiki/Connection-Manager">infrastructure concerns</a>, so that you can focus on making the most of your data. 
* <a href="https://github.com/liberation-data/drivine/wiki/Transactions">Removes boiler plate code</a>, especially the tedious and error-prone kind. 
* <a href="https://github.com/liberation-data/drivine/wiki/Cursors">Supports streaming</a>, without back-pressure. Large amounts of data can be managed in a timely and memory efficient manner. 
* Light-weight _use-case specific_ <a href="https://github.com/liberation-data/drivine/wiki/Object-Mapping">object graph mapping (OGM)</a>.

## Quick Start

Start creating repositories like the one below. Follow the **<a href="https://github.com/liberation-data/drivine/wiki/Quick-Start">Quick Start</a>** guide **<a href="https://github.com/liberation-data/drivine/wiki/Quick-Start">here</a>**. 

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class RouteRepository {
    constructor(
        @InjectPersistenceManager() readonly persistenceManager: PersistenceManager,
        @InjectCypher('@/traffic/routesBetween') readonly routesBetween: CypherStatement) {
    }

    @Transactional() // Has default Propagation.REQUIRED - partipicate in a current txn, or start one.
    public async findFastestBetween(start: string, destination: string): Promise<Route> {
        return this.persistenceManager.getOne(
            new QuerySpecification<Route>()
                .withStatement(this.routesBetween)
                .bind([start, destination])
                .limit(1)
                .transform(Route)
        );
    }
}
```

## Quickest Start

Clone the **[sample app](https://github.com/liberation-data/drivine-inspiration)** and start hacking. 

The sample app contains a basic starter template. Also, so that you can get rolling as quickly as possible, a number a graph database koans, for typical use-cases - recommendations, social networks, etc, each presented in a Drivine style.

## About

Drivine was created by [Jasper Blues](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasper-blues-7781638) (that's me), who is also 
the creator of a popular iOS library called [Typhoon](https://github.com/appsquickly/typhoon) from 
[AppsQuick.ly](https://appsquick.ly). Typhoon is included in thousands of iOS apps including Audible.com, 
AMEX, Etihad Airlines, Singapore Airlines and others, so you're in good hands. 

The ideas behind this library were developed while developing graph-powered applications like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vampr/id1069819177">Vampr</a>, which serve hundres/thousands of thransactions per second. I wanted to demonstrate how to use clean architecture patterns, and tools that remove boiler-plate, without sacrificing performance. I was informed in this tasks through experience as a past committer to the [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/) including on [Spring Data Neo4j](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-neo4j). More iportantly, discussion and debate with colleagues, especially among those with experience applying mapping frameworks on applications that needed to exhibit high performance guided design choices.  I believe that Drivine strikes an excellent balance in these regards. Let me know what you think.
